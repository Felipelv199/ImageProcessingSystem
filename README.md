# ImageProcessingSystem
This project implements an API that oversees handling HTTP requests, request validation and workloads scheduling; and a CUDA framework integration in remote workers with RPC-based communication between the scheduler and the workers. The main task of this system is to process with CUDA images that the client uploads.
